# HEALES Application Guidelines for Google Summer of Code

Thanks for your interest in joining HEALES through GSoC! Here’s how to get started and make the most of your application.

## How to Apply

1. **Explore Our Projects**: Take a look at the [HEALES GSoC Ideas List] and pick a project that matches your interests. If you’re unsure or have your own idea, feel free to reach out to mentors for guidance. Your ideas don’t need to be polished—early discussions are encouraged!  
2. **Draft Your Proposal**:
   - Explain the project idea in your own words and how you plan to approach it.
   - Break your plan into weekly milestones with clear deliverables.
   - Mention any tools, technologies, or techniques you’ll use.
   - Share your background—skills, experience, and why you’re excited about the project.

We recommend getting in touch with mentors early to refine your proposal and get feedback.

## Biology/Bioinformatics Background  

While most projects don’t require biology or bioinformatics knowledge, many of our use cases are biology-related. If you’ve taken biology courses (even online ones), worked on related projects, or have experience in longevity research, mention it—it’s a big plus!  

If needed, we may suggest readings, online courses, or tools to learn before the official GSoC coding period starts so we can hit the ground running.

## What We Expect

- **Proactive Engagement**: Stay in touch with mentors regularly. Ask questions, share ideas, and provide updates often. Don’t wait until the last minute!  
- **Intermediate Check-Ins**: We’ll review intermediate commits and evaluate progress throughout the program to keep things on track.  
- **Familiarity with Our Work**: Check out libraries and tools already written by HEALES to better understand our work and how you can contribute.

## Prerequisites  

- Familiarity with Git/GitHub and open-source workflows.  
- Basic knowledge of tools relevant to the project (e.g., Python).  
- Optional but encouraged: Make a small contribution (like a pull request) before applying to show your interest.

## Tips for Your Proposal  

- Be specific about what you want to achieve and how you’ll do it.  
- Include a clear timeline with milestones.  
- Highlight any biology-related experience or longevity research involvement if applicable.  
- Show enthusiasm and explain why this project excites you.

## Communication  

Once accepted, stay in touch with mentors regularly—weekly updates are key. We’re here to help guide you through the process and make this a rewarding experience!

We’re excited to see your ideas and welcome you to the HEALES community!
