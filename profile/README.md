# Longevity Genie

**Open-source AI assistant for health, genetics, and longevity research.**

Built on existing language models, integrating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), hybrid search, and AI agent workflows. Delivers accurate information from diverse scientific sources by accessing specialized biological databases.

The project aims to facilitate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the biology of aging and other biomedical domains. As a side-effect of developing several general-purpose libraries for LLM agents, frameworks for search and chat have also been created.

## Key Features

- **Integration with Biological Databases:** Accesses specialized databases to provide precise health-related information.
- **Hybrid Search Capabilities:** Combines traditional search methods with advanced semantic search techniques.
- **AI Agent Workflows:** Utilizes orchestration logic to streamline interactions between LLMs and external tools.
